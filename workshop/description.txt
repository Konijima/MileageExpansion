[h1]Mileage Expansion[/h1]

Introducing the "Mileage Expansion" mod, a game-changer for all vehicle enthusiasts! Get ready to embark on a journey of realism and immersion as this mod brings a whole new level of authenticity to your favorite game.

With the "Mileage Expansion" mod, every vehicle in the game now has its own unique mileage system.
As you hit the road, every mile you traverse will be recorded and accounted for. 

The mod introduces a comprehensive mileage tracking system that keeps tabs on the distance you've traveled in each vehicle. 
Whether you're cruising down the highways, off-roading through rugged terrains, or soaring through the skies, every adventure will leave its mark on your vehicle's odometer.

[h2]Features:[/h2]
[b]Random Starting Mileage[/b]
Every existing and new car will have a unique starting mileage based on its initial engine condition.

[b]Mileage Counter Options[/b]
Clicking the mileage counter opens a menu with options to switch between metric and imperial units and access the trip odometer.

[b]Resettable Trip Odometer[/b]
The trip odometer can be reset to zero, allowing you to track distances for specific trips or periods.

[b]Admin Mileage Cheat[/b]
The admin has the ability to modify the vehicle's mileage using the mechanic overlay for testing or administrative purposes.

[b]Engine-Based Mileage[/b]
Mileage data is stored on the vehicle's engine rather than on the vehicle itself.

[b]One Meter Equals One Tile Square[/b]
The in-game measurement system equates one meter to one tile square.

[b]Kilometer to Mile Conversion[/b]
Mileage is saved in kilometers but displayed in miles on the counter when the imperial unit is enabled.

[b]Persistent Metric/Imperial Setting[/b]
The chosen metric/imperial unit setting is saved on the vehicle, ensuring that other players see the mileage in the last set unit.

[b]Action-Based Operations[/b]
Switching between metric/imperial units, showing/hiding the trip odometer, and resetting the trip odometer are actual actions that require time to complete.
